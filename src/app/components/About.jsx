            Our Journey with Desknet's NEO
          </h2>
          <p>
            <span className="font-semibold text-[#3C8CDE]">Desknet's NEO by Inspire</span> is more than just a software application focusing on business tools; it's a reflection of the Inspire Next Global Inc.'s passion for bringing the best of Japan to the Philippines. For years, Inspire has been dedicated to introducing high-quality Japanese products to the local market, and Desknet's NEO is a shining example of that commitment.
          </p>
          <p>
            At its heart, Desknet's NEO is a smart, all-in-one platform designed to make everyday work easier. It helps teams stay organized, communicate better, and manage tasks more efficiently, whether you're working in a small business or a large organization. With over <span className="font-semibold text-[#3C8CDE]">21 built-in tools</span>, from scheduling and task tracking to document sharing and approval workflows, everything you need is just a few clicks away.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it's not just about the features; it's about mindset. Inspire believes that Japanese technology and culture offer something truly valuable: a thoughtful, disciplined approach to getting things done. And we believe this can make a real difference here in the Philippines.
          </p>
          <p>
            By bringing Desknet's NEO to Filipino professionals, Inspire hopes to spark a shift toward more organized, collaborative, and future-ready workplaces. It's about giving teams the tools they need to thriveâ€”and sharing a bit of Japan's innovative spirit along the way.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#3C8CDE] text-center mt-8">
            Because when people have the right tools and the right mindset, amazing things can happen.
